## About the Project:

I turned a  multi-page [`openai.com`](https://openai.com/) site into a single page application.

## Setup / Installation:

```jsx
npm i
npm start
```

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Technologies Used:

* React
* Redux
* TS
* Styled components
* Json-server

## Description:

Inspired by neural networks, I decided to make a web application for the product. Since I don't have a layout, I used openai.com as the layout.

Decided to try typescript+react+redux+styled-components for this project.

## View now

I connected a fake server (json-server) to store data.
The application interacts with the server using the REST API.
